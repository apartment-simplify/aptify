## Feature Overview
Provide an auditability and governance framework ensuring every AI-assisted action is traceable, compliant, and aligned with agency risk policies, enabling defensible evidence for regulators and tribunals.

## Target Users
- Compliance Managers responsible for governance.
- Risk Officers monitoring AI safety.
- External Auditors reviewing platform usage.

## Key Functional Requirements
1. **Comprehensive Activity Logging**
   - Capture AI prompts, outputs, user edits, approvals, exports with timestamps and identifiers.
   - Support immutable storage and tamper detection.
2. **Access Control & Permissions**
   - Role-based access aligned to least privilege, MFA/SSO integration, session monitoring.
3. **Audit Trail Explorer**
   - Searchable interface to filter events by entity, user, time, action type.
   - Export evidence packets for tribunals or compliance reviews.
4. **Policy Enforcement Engine**
   - Configure guardrails (e.g., mandatory approvals, refusal rules) per customer.
   - Monitor adherence and alert on violations.
5. **Governance Reporting**
   - Dashboards for AI usage, refusals, overrides, model cost, data residency compliance.

## AI Enhancements
- **Risk Scoring**: Evaluate actions for risk level based on sensitivity, missing citations, user role.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flag unusual behaviour (e.g., excessive data exports, repeated override of refusals).
- **Policy Recommendation**: Suggest guardrail adjustments based on incident trends.
- **Automated Evidence Summaries**: Compile narrative explaining sequence of events for audits.
- **Data Minimisation Checks**: Detect PII leakage risk in AI responses and trigger redaction workflows.

## User Flows
1. Incident review → Compliance manager opens audit explorer → Filters by case → Downloads evidence pack with AI summary.
2. Policy update → Risk officer adjusts guardrail settings → System propagates to copilot prompts → Logs change.
3. High-risk action → Risk score exceeds threshold → Automatic notification to compliance → Investigation triggered.
4. Quarterly governance report → Copilot drafts overview with metrics, anomalies, recommendations.
5. Access request → Admin reviews user role → Approves/denies with justification → Logged for audit.

## Success Metrics
- Zero unresolved audit log gaps during compliance inspections.
- Detect ≥95% of policy violations within 1 hour.
- Reduce manual effort preparing audit evidence by 60%.
- Maintain MFA adoption at 100% for privileged users.
- Keep guardrail override rate <3% per month.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with GRC platforms for automated control mapping.
- Continuous compliance monitoring aligned with ISO 27001 and SOC 2.
- Automated privacy impact assessments for new AI features.
- Real-time red teaming simulations with synthetic incidents.
- Cryptographic signing of audit logs for non-repudiation.
