## Feature Overview
Build a knowledge management and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) corpus that ingests agency documents, policies, and communications to power accurate AI responses with verifiable citations.

## Target Users
- Knowledge Managers curating policy content.
- Compliance Officers ensuring authoritative sources.
- AI/ML Engineers tuning retrieval quality.

## Key Functional Requirements
1. **Content Ingestion Pipeline**
   - Support PDFs, DOCX, HTML, email archives, structured CSVs.
   - Apply OCR, metadata tagging, deduplication, and version control.
2. **Metadata & Taxonomy Management**
   - Tag documents by property, jurisdiction, policy type, effective dates.
   - Maintain change logs and deprecation workflows.
3. **Embedding & Indexing**
   - Generate embeddings and keyword indices for hybrid search.
   - Store in vector database with access controls.
4. **Citation Framework**
   - Provide paragraph-level anchors and highlight matched sections in responses.
5. **Quality Monitoring**
   - Measure retrieval precision/recall, freshness, and citation accuracy with evaluation datasets.

## AI Enhancements
- **Adaptive Retrieval**: Blend semantic and keyword search with reranking tuned to tenancy jargon.
- **Source Summarisation**: Produce concise abstracts for long documents to improve retrieval relevance.
- **Obsolescence Detection**: Flag outdated policies or conflicting versions using temporal reasoning.
- **Feedback Incorporation**: Capture user upvotes/downvotes on citations to refine retrieval weights.
- **Knowledge Gap Analysis**: Identify topics lacking coverage and recommend ingestion priorities.

## User Flows
1. New policy uploaded → Pipeline processes → Knowledge manager reviews metadata → Document published to corpus.
2. Copilot answers question → RAG retrieves segments → Response generated with citations → User views source preview.
3. Compliance update → Obsolescence detector flags outdated clause → Manager replaces document → Version history captured.
4. Retrieval evaluation → Data scientist runs benchmark → Adjusts model weights → Performance dashboard updated.
5. Knowledge gap report → System highlights missing content for new region → Manager schedules ingestion.

## Success Metrics
- Maintain citation accuracy ≥95%.
- Keep average document freshness <30 days for critical policies.
- Achieve ≥90% retrieval precision on evaluation set.
- Reduce manual document search time by 70%.
- Capture feedback on ≥50% of AI responses for continuous improvement.

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-tenant knowledge segregation with federated search across agencies.
- Automatic ingestion from government regulatory feeds.
- Support for multimedia knowledge (videos, podcasts) with transcript indexing.
- Explainable retrieval visualisations for auditors.
- Knowledge graph construction linking entities for advanced reasoning.
