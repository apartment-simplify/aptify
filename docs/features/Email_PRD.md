## Feature Overview
Deliver an AI-assisted email management workspace that automatically classifies inbound/outbound emails, applies consistent tagging, and captures user feedback to continuously optimise property management workflows.

## Target Users
- Property Management Assistants triaging busy shared inboxes.
- Senior Property Managers overseeing escalations and compliance.
- Tenant Support Agents responding to enquiries and tracking follow-ups.
- Operations Analysts monitoring communication performance and training data quality.

## Key Functional Requirements
1. **Automated Classification**
   - Categorise emails into core intents (maintenance, rent, compliance, general enquiry, vendor coordination).
   - Detect related property, tenant, and ticket references from structured data.
   - Provide confidence scores with override controls.
2. **Tagging & Label Management**
   - Apply configurable tags (priority, SLA risk, region, campaign) aligned with reporting needs.
   - Support bulk tag edits and history tracking for audits.
   - Sync tags with ticketing/CRM systems through APIs or exports.
3. **Queue Orchestration**
   - Route classified emails to the correct queue or owner with workload balancing.
   - Surface suggested next actions (draft reply, create work order, schedule inspection).
   - Integrate with notifications to alert on urgent or overdue items.
4. **Feedback Capture**
   - Present inline thumbs up/down, correction notes, and reclassification tools.
   - Log adjustments with contextual snapshots for review and training pipelines.
   - Provide dashboards showing feedback trends, resolution SLAs, and model accuracy.
5. **Compliance & Audit**
   - Maintain immutable logs of classifications, tags, overrides, and responder actions.
   - Enforce retention, redaction, and access controls aligned with Australian privacy requirements.
   - Offer exportable audit packages for regulators and client reporting.

## AI Enhancements
- **Intent Detection Models**: Fine-tuned classifiers leveraging historical agency emails with domain-specific vocabulary.
- **Entity Linking**: Use NER and fuzzy matching to associate emails with existing tickets, properties, tenants, and vendors.
- **Adaptive Tag Suggestions**: Recommend tags based on similar past communications and evolving taxonomy usage.
- **Personalised Draft Prompts**: Trigger copilot reply drafts pre-populated with policy citations and previous thread context.
- **Feedback Loop Integration**: Incorporate validated corrections into retraining datasets with automated evaluation guardrails.

## User Flows
1. Email arrives → System classifies and tags → Suggested action displayed → Agent reviews and confirms or adjusts.
2. Agent disagrees with classification → Submits correction with note → Feedback enters review queue → Model retraining ticket created.
3. Manager reviews daily queue → Filters by tag (e.g., "High Priority Maintenance") → Assigns tasks or requests additional info.
4. Compliance audit → Export log showing email content summary, tags applied, responders, and approval timestamps.
5. Quarterly model update → ML Ops team analyses feedback metrics → Deploys updated classifier with communicated changelog.

## Success Metrics
- Achieve ≥90% accuracy on top-level intent classification measured monthly.
- Reduce average email triage time by 50% compared to baseline manual process.
- Ensure <5% of emails require manual reclassification after deployment.
- Capture feedback on ≥30% of AI-assisted actions during first 60 days to fuel optimisation.
- Maintain compliance audit findings at zero critical issues.

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-lingual classification for agencies serving diverse tenant communities.
- Proactive summarisation of long threads with highlight extraction.
- Predictive backlog forecasting and staffing recommendations based on email volume trends.
- Deep integration with voice intake to unify omnichannel tagging and reporting.
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback to personalise routing per agency preference.
